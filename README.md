# Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive CRM data analysis for a leading bank, focused on reducing customer churn, improving service delivery, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
As an analytical CRM specialist, I utilized multiple customer-related datasets — including demographics, transaction histories, exit records, and active customer profiles — to uncover actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.
The project aims to identify key churn drivers, understand customer behavior patterns, and provide data-backed recommendations to strengthen customer retention and loyalty.

# Key Features
- Customer Segmentation: Classified customers based on demographics, account type, and transaction behavior to identify high-value and at-risk groups.
- Churn Analysis: Investigated churn trends and developed insights into factors contributing to customer attrition.
- Transaction Insights: Analyzed transaction frequency, average balance, and product usage to evaluate engagement levels.
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Estimated CLV to prioritize retention strategies for profitable customers.
- Service Performance Evaluation: Assessed service delivery gaps impacting customer satisfaction.
- Behavioral Pattern Recognition: Detected behavioral shifts in inactive or low-engagement customers.
- Retention Strategy Design: Provided actionable insights and recommendations for improving retention and loyalty programs.
-KPI Reporting: Developed key metrics such as churn rate, engagement index, and satisfaction score for business monitoring.

# Methodology
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured datasets from multiple sources (demographics, transactions, churn data, active profiles).
- SQL & Excel Analysis: Leveraged SQL for data querying, filtering, and aggregation; used Excel Pivot Tables and visual dashboards for exploratory analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key churn indicators using descriptive statistics and trend evaluation.
- Segmentation & Profiling: Grouped customers by risk levels, demographics, and engagement activity.
- Actionable Insights: Derived patterns linking churn behavior to demographic and transactional variables.
- Visualization: Created charts and dashboards to communicate findings effectively to the CRM and Strategy teams.

# Conclusion
This project delivers a data-driven roadmap to help the bank strengthen its CRM operations, minimize churn, and maximize customer satisfaction.
By identifying the root causes of attrition and profiling loyal customers, the analysis empowers leadership to implement personalized engagement strategies, optimize service performance, and improve long-term profitability.
The findings form the basis for predictive retention initiatives and customer-centric growth strategies, positioning the bank for sustainable success.
